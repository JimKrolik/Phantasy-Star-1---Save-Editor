# Phantasy Star 1 - Save Editor
A save editor for modifying an SRM (non save state) save file for Phantasy Star 1.

I started this project as a way to understand the inner workings of how the Genesis and Master System save their game data.

Some might ask why I even bother with how old the retro consoles are these days, but being able to manipulate a save gives some insight into how the game works and 
was programmed.  Some might also ask why not just edit a save state in an emulator with the vast amount of different emulators on the market and them also offering save states.  
The answer is simple:  a save state is emulator specific. 

This is editing the actual save file that is able to be read by the console and is inherently emulator agnostic.  
So if you had the means to do so, you could copy the save back to the cartridge and give it a run on actual hardware.

Are you looking to curtail the game to your will and give yourself a new challenge or just blaze through it for fun?
Do you want to give yourself a fun challenge and face Dark Force solo?
Do you want to start the game maxed out with gear and stats?



Disclaimer: I realize this could be used to exploit achievements on achievement based websites (such as RetroAchievements) that integrate with classic games, 
but I fully support the idea of learning for the sake of knowledge and understanding how things work.
